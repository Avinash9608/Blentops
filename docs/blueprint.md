- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5), providing a neutral, clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#7ECA9C), used in interactive elements like buttons and links, provides a subtle but distinct call to action.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. Provides a modern, machined, objective, neutral look that ensures legibility and professionalism throughout the admin panel.
- Sidebar navigation on the left for main sections, top navbar for user profile and logout. Card-based design with clear spacing and soft shadows to differentiate content blocks.
- Use a consistent style of minimalist icons for navigation and actions. Icons should be clear, recognizable, and relevant to their functions.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects to enhance user interaction without being distracting. For example, smooth transitions between dashboard sections or slight button animations.
